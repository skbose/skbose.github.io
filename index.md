Hello, folks!

Hi, I'm Sourav. I'm a computer scientist with a passion to build creative applications that leverage AI. I am an Applied AI engineer at LinkedIn. Kolkata, the "City of Joy," is where I hail from. When I'm not working, I enjoy losing myself in the world of music.

This blog is an attempt to collect my thoughts, ideas and experiments.
