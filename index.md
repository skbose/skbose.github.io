# Introduction

Hello, folks!

Hi, I'm Sourav. I'm a computer scientist with a passion to build creative applications that leverage AI. I am an Applied AI engineer at LinkedIn. Kolkata, the "City of Joy," is where I hail from. When I'm not working, I enjoy losing myself in the world of music.

I'm making an effort to keep record of my ideas, thoughts, and projects on this blog. I've been giving Badminton a shot lately.
