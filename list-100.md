# List 100

Inspired by [Chip Huyen's List-100]([https://huyenchip.com/list-100/](https://huyenchip.com/list-100/)) (which I strongly recommend), I intend to make my own list of things I want in life. I'll consider what kind of experience I'd actually appreciate and share my thoughts on this site. One thing I will do differently is talk about the experience in greater depth in the hopes of inspiring others!

If you've got any recommendations to add to this list, let me know!

1. Sky-diving in Dubai
2. Record a classical raga (on flute) in a studio
